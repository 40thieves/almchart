## AlmChart

### Visualising Altmetrics Data Changes Over Time

Javascript library for creating a visualisation of altmetrics data and shows its change over time. Data must be retrieved from the Public Library of Science (PLOS) [ALM API](http://alm.plos.org/).

### Dependencies

* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* [d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip)

### Usage

A demo is included in the `demo` directory of this repository, showing the usage of the library.

#### Drawing the chart

##### 1. Include library files

Include the `chart.js` file (and optionally the `chart.css` file)

##### 2. Create an root element for the chart

```html
<svg id="chart"></svg>
```

##### 3. Boot the library

Provide options to the library. Required options are `el` and `url`.

```js
var chart = new AlmChart({
	el: document.querySelector('#chart'),
	url: 'data/almreport.json'
});
```

You can optionally set the following options:

* `el` _[required]_ The element where the chart will be appended
* `url` _[required]_ URL to the data (in JSON format)
* `width` Width of the chart
* `height` Height of the chart
* `margin` Object (with `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right` properties) defining the margins around the chart
* `dataSourceKeys` Object (with `x` and `y` properties) defining the names of the selected data sources, as used by the `sources` array in the data
* `dataSourceNames` Object (with `x` and `y` properties) defining the human-readable names of the selected data sources, to be shown on the relevant axes

##### 4. Draw the chart

Call the `draw()` method on the library.

```js
chart.draw();
```

#### Changing the selected data sources

Once the chart has been initialised, the selected data sources for the x- and y-axes can be changed using the `setConfig()` method, and redrawn.

```js
chart.setConfig({
	dataSourceKeys: {
		x: 'facebook',
		y: 'mendeley'
	},
	dataSourceNames: {
		x: 'Facebook likes',
		y: 'Mendeley saves'
	}
});

chart.draw();
```

This method can also be used to change any options set on the library.
